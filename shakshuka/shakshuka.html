    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>

    <p>Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish 
        featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions,
        bell pepper, and garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast,
        but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with
        lots of bread to mop up the sauce.
